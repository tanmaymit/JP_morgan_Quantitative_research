The JPMorgan Chase Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program on Forage offers a hands-on simulation that allows participants to explore the role of a quantitative researcher. The program typically involves tasks that reflect the type of work done by quantitative researchers at JPMorgan Chase, focusing on financial data analysis, predictive modeling, and risk assessment.

Key Tasks and Objectives:
Data Analysis:

Analyze a dataset related to financial products, such as a book of loans or other financial instruments.
Use statistical methods and data analysis tools to identify trends, correlations, and patterns within the data.
Probability of Default Estimation:

Estimate the probability of default for loans or other financial products based on the data provided.
This involves applying quantitative methods and possibly using machine learning models to predict default risks.
Dynamic Programming for Data Transformation:

Use dynamic programming techniques to transform complex data (e.g., FICO scores) into categories or different formats.
This step is crucial for simplifying the data for further analysis and improving the accuracy of predictions.
Predictive Modeling:

Develop and implement predictive models using tools like Python.
The goal is to enhance the accuracy of the probability estimations by using advanced algorithms.
